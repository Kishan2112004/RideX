# RideX
A multithreaded C++ project simulating a ride-hailing service, built using core Object-Oriented Programming principles and modern Software Design Patterns. This project demonstrates how real-world ride-hailing apps (like Uber & Ola) can be modeled with clean design and concurrency handling.
